# Microsoft Engage-2022
* The Challenge
	* Develop an application to demonstrate how the Automotive Industry could harness data to take informed decisions.
	* You could choose to use the data set provided, or use any open-source data set available you might have access to, or create your own.
	* Demonstrate the use of data analytics in identifying: Customer segments, Most popular car specification combination (engine type, fuel, mileage, etc), Right time to launch a new car, etc

# Agile development Methodology
* I divided the one-month program into four sprints. Each sprint consisted of one week period.
* I categorized my sprints into four sections - exploration, basic working model, features creation, adapt phase.
* We were given a problem statement in which we had to make an app for car manufacturers that uses data analysis at its core
* After thinking about the problem statement, I decided to use python for creating a machine learning model that would predict the price of a car with specified features based on its intended audience
* In the second week, I studied and experimented with various algorithms before deciding on XGBoost as it is very efficient and one of the widely used algorithms on kaggle.
* In the third week, I studied about backend development since I had only experience with competetive coding, python and some front-end. I decided to use express as it was easier to learn and widely used
* In the fourth week, I made the website and hooked it all together and fixed some bugs.

# Features
* Since this was a problem statement focusing mainly on data analysis, I decided to invest more time in making the prediction model.
* The Dashboard is fairly simple. The values can be plugged in the form provided.
* The server runs the script and provides the estimated price of the car.
* It also renders interactive graphs in real time.
* It also shows the performance of the car in various aspects(power, engine , mileage, etc.) compared to the cars there in it's price segment.

# Furture Work
* The next version of the application will feature a cleaner UI.
* Adding feature to compare your car with other cars side by side.
* Clean the backend to make it more readable and modulated.
* Add features to generate more graphs based on feature provided by the user.
* Edge case detection and filter out values out of bound(negative values)
